# terraformproject

This is a sample project to spin up a haproxy on the ec2 instance with a network load balancer created and updated in the haproxy config file.
This is for a use case where haproxy acts as a proxy if the customer wants a static IP to send messages to and this in turn routes to  the load balancer
